# good-and-bad-calendars

I'm using this repo as an example for an upcoming video for my youtube.

to see the bad calendar (slow lookups) run:

```
npx nx serve calendar
```

and go to `http://localhost:4200`.

To see a better calendar, run the command:

```
npx nx serve better-calendar --port=4201
```

and go to `http://localhost:4201`.
